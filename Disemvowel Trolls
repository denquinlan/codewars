/* Problem: Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

//Solution:
function disemvowel(str) {
  const newStr = str
  .replace(/a/g, '')
  .replace(/e/g, '')
  .replace(/i/g, '')
  .replace(/o/g, '')
  .replace(/u/g, '')
  .replace(/A/g, '')
  .replace(/E/g, '')
  .replace(/I/g, '')
  .replace(/O/g, '')
  .replace(/U/g, '')
  return newStr
}

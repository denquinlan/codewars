/* Problem: There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

Return True if you're better, else False!
*/

//Solution:
function betterThanAverage(classPoints, yourPoints) {
 //Add my points to the array of points and create a variable for the sum
  classPoints.push(yourPoints);
  let sum = 0;
//Cycle through the array and add all the points together
 for (let i = 0; i < classPoints.length; i++) {
   sum += classPoints[i];
}
//Find the average  
  sum = sum/classPoints.length
//Figure out if I scored higher than the address  
  if (sum < yourPoints){
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }

}
